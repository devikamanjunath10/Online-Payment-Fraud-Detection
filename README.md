# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection
Online payment fraud detection leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze transactional data and identify fraudulent activities in real-time.ML models are trained on historical transaction data, including features like payment amount, location, time, and user behavior, to detect anomalies or suspicious patterns. Popular techniques include classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees) and anomaly detection methods.
Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical data, ensures the model is effective. Once trained, the system can evaluate new transactions in real time, flagging potentially fraudulent ones for further review. Advanced implementations often combine ML with techniques like feature engineering, real-time monitoring, and graph-based analytics for enhanced accuracy and scalability.
